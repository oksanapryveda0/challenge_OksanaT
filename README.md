* Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

Hi to everyone who read this story. 

It is kind a weird one :)

I gradueted from technical university with 2 red diplomas. I'm a software engineer according to my diploma.

On 4th year of study I finished with random 'freelances' and as I participated in almost all programming contests, I was sure that I'm done with codding. 
I find and entered into some testing course and got a job offer. 
I'm pretty good at testing, but now I do not feel that joy from work and trully - I love codding. 

And I was just happy to see oportunity to challenge myself.
